             Hi! My name is Ari Ghazarian! I am a Lebanese-Armenian graduate from LAU. I plan to finish my BS
            degree by the end of 2024. I went to a mostly Armenian school and grew up in a mostly Armenian social
            circle and because of this I am fluent in 4 different languages. <br> <br>
            I have been interested in programming and tech since I was a kid but I only properly started learning
            programming when I finished High School and started University. I really enjoy developing games for<br>
             fun as side projects. <br> <br>
             I also have two cats :) <br> <br>

            As mentioned earlier, I often delve into game development, often messing with different engines
            to see what I like best. I currently have two main projcts I am working on, both inspired by
            multiple different franchises/media I was a fan of as a kid. I mainly do for-fun work, however
            a lot of my systems are often still fairly complex. <br> <br>

            Additionally, I like to engage in art/drawing, originally started from working on spritework and
            assets for my games, but eventually evolved into me just casually drawing for fun. <br> <br>

            Apart from those two, I love to bake! Pies, bread, croissants, and more! I like to bake different 
            pastries and breads for fun often on weekends. It's a good way for me to destress after a long
            week of work. <br> <br> <br>
